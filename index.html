			<h2>I am Kin Lane, the API Evangelist...</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This is my work in partnership with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to move forward the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/schema/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, in conjunction with a definition for the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a>. I've dedicated a portion of my time as the API Evangelist to help move forward the conversation about how we store, share, publish, and collaborate around human services data.</p>
		<p>I began this work with Greg Bloom (<a href="https://twitter.com/greggish">@greggish</a>) of <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a> back in 2015 and 2016, and signed on as the technical lead by 2017. I'm invested in the projects success, and will invest as much time as I possibly can helping contribute to the data schema, API definition, tooling, and storytelling. I feel the project reflects the API potential, helping make our world work better for humans, not just something that tech startups do.</p>
    <p>This is a working HSDA portal showing what is possible with an API that speaks the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). Everything you should be available here on this HSDA portal.</p>
